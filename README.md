# Predicting the Structure of Synaptophysin and Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau

This project uses ColabFold, a tool that uses AlphaFold for its predictions, to predict the 3D structures of synaptophysin and tau protein across humans, bovines and mice. Using ChimeraX for analysis, these predictions have been evaluated through root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT) scores. The findings indicate high-confidence predictions for synaptophysin across humans, bovines, and mice. Findings also show that the structure of synaptophysin across humans, bovines, and mice is largely similar. Conversely, tau protein, known for being an inherently disordered protein, shows predominantly low confidence in structure predictions and its structure varies across species. Future work could delve deeper into the lower-confidence regions, such as the yellow-colored alpha helix in synaptophysin predictions, and perform detailed analyses on specific tau protein segments instead of looking at the entire protein.
